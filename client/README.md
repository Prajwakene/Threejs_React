# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## This command will install the following packages:
### npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei maath valtio react-color framer-motion
three: The Three.js library, which is a 3D graphics library for JavaScript.
@react-three/fiber: The React bindings for Three.js, providing a way to use Three.js within a React application.
@react-three/drei: A set of useful helpers and abstractions for Three.js to simplify common tasks.
maath: It's unclear what this package is, as there is no commonly known package with this name. Double-check the package name to make sure it's correct.
valtio: A minimalist state management library for React applications.
react-color: A color picker component for React.
framer-motion: A popular animation library for React applications.
